# GraCe
GraCe is a FOSS implementation of the Apple Wireless Direct Link(AWDL)-Protocol. It relies on monitor mode and currently only works on linux.

## Name
GraCe stands for **Gr**e**a**t **C**hann**e**l Hopper. It's named in honor of Grace Hopper, because AWDL hops between channels. And yes, I came up with the acronym before I came up with the meaning... In my defense, it was late at night.
